# 🚨 Inventory Stockout Analyzer

### SQL-based inventory analysis system identifying stockout risks and optimizing reorder decisions

</div>

---

## 💼 Business Problem

Retailers and distributors face two costly inventory challenges:

- **Stockouts** → Lost sales and unhappy customers  
- **Overstock** → Capital tied up in slow-moving products

This system analyzes inventory data to provide actionable recommendations that reduce both risks and optimize working capital.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 📊 Critical Stockout Alerts
Automatically identifies products at risk with three urgency levels:

- 🚨 **CRITICAL** – Out of stock  
- ⚠️ **URGENT** – Below safety stock  
- ⚡ **WARNING** – Below reorder point

### 📈 ABC Inventory Classification
Applies the Pareto principle to categorize products by value:

- **A-items:** Top 20% of products = 80% of inventory value  
- **B-items:** Next 30% of products = 15% of value  
- **C-items:** Bottom 50% of products = 5% of value

### 🔄 Inventory Turnover Analysis
Measures how efficiently inventory is sold by category, identifying slow-moving products that tie up capital.

### 💰 Smart Reorder Recommendations
Calculates optimal reorder quantities based on:

- Current stock levels  
- Safety stock requirements  
- Average daily sales velocity  
- Supplier lead times

### 🏭 Supplier Performance Tracking
Evaluates suppliers on on-time delivery rates to prioritize reliable vendors for critical reorders.

## 💡 Key Findings

From analyzing 150 products across 6 categories:

### 📦 Inventory Health

- Total Inventory Value: $1,041,418  
- Products Out of Stock: 0 (0%)  
- Products Below Reorder Point: 0 (0%)  

Well-stocked inventory with no critical stockout alerts.

### 📈 ABC Analysis Results

- 20% of products account for 80% of inventory value (classic Pareto)  
- Enables focused management on high-value A-category items  
- Opportunity to reduce safety stock on low-value C-category items

### 🔄 Turnover Insights

- Average turnover varies significantly by category  
- Identifies fast-moving vs. slow-moving product groups  
- Enables data-driven purchasing and stocking decisions

### 🏭 Supplier Metrics

- Tracked 20 suppliers across 100 purchase orders  
- Calculated on-time delivery percentages per supplier  
- Risk assessment for critical reorders based on historical performance
